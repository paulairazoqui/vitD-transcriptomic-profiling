    "The UMAP projection of gene expression signatures across selected cell lines reveals the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Clear separation** is observed for the PC3 cell line, which forms a distinct and compact cluster—suggesting a **consistent and unique transcriptomic response** compared to the other lines.\n",
    "- **Partial overlap** is present among MCF7, A549, HA1E, and U2OS, indicating **shared or more variable expression profiles**, possibly due to common pathways or cell-type similarities.\n",
    "- UMAP maintains meaningful **local structure** in the data, capturing both discrete and continuous relationships between samples.\n",
    "- Unlike PCA, UMAP is non-linear and does not provide explained variance metrics, but its **visual separability** implies underlying biological differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "> These observations highlight how transcriptional responses to perturbagens can vary by cell type. While some cell lines (e.g., PC3) respond in a well-defined manner, others exhibit broader variability, potentially reflecting differences in lineage, basal gene expression, or compound sensitivity.\n",
