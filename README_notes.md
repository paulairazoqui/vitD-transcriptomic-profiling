### 📝 Notes for README – Cell Line-Specific Response

- PCA revealed that transcriptional signatures clustered **more clearly by cell line** than by compound.
- Signatures from **PC3 cells** showed a distinct transcriptional profile, separated from MCF7, U2OS, A549, and HA1E.
- This suggests that:
  - The response to vitamin D analogs is **cell-context dependent**.
  - PC3 may regulate a **different subset of genes** or show altered pathway activation compared to the other lines.
- These differences could reflect:
  - Variations in vitamin D receptor (VDR) expression,
  - Basal transcriptional states of the cells,
  - Or compound-cell line interactions affecting downstream signaling.

> 👉 Will highlight this as a key biological observation in the README summary and discussion.
